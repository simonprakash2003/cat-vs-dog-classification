# cat-vs-dog-classification

# Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for classifying images as either cats or dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing a diverse collection of cat and dog images, allowing it to distinguish between the two species with high accuracy.

# Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive dataset with a wide variety of cat and dog images.
TensorFlow and Keras: Implemented using popular deep learning libraries for ease of use and flexibility.
Preprocessing: Includes data preprocessing steps to enhance model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for assessing model performance.

# result

Our model achieves an accuracy of 90% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between cats and dogs in images.
